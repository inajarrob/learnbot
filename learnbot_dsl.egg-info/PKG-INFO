        # learnbot-dsl
        
        This project has been designed as a tool to learn different topics, like programing, logic, math, emotions, physic, robotic, ... 
        
        The methodology used to teach this knowledges is the following:
        The kids make programs, with a IDE (Learnblock) this programs and this programs control a smal robot (EBO).
        
        ## Learnblock
        
        This program is the main.  It is here where the kids make his/her programs. This programs can be created with language similar to scratch, that is to say, using blocks.
        
        ## EBO 
        
        EBO is a smal robot, that run some components that ofert interfaces to control it.
